# Graph building concepts

When writing csp code there will be runtime components in the form of `csp.node` methods, as well as graph-building components in the form of `csp.graph` components.

It is important to understand that `csp.graph` components will only be executed once at application startup in order to construct the graph.
Once the graph is constructed, `csp.graph` code is no longer needed.
Once the graph is run, only inputs, csp.nodes and outputs will be active as data flows through the graph, driven by input ticks.
For example, this is a simple bit of graph code:

```python
import csp
from csp import ts
from datetime import datetime


@csp.node
def spread(bid: ts[float], ask: ts[float]) -> ts[float]:
    if csp.valid(bid, ask):
        return ask - bid


@csp.graph
def my_graph():
    bid = csp.const(1.0)
    ask = csp.const(2.0)
    bid = csp.multiply(bid, csp.const(4))
    ask = csp.multiply(ask, csp.const(3))
    s = spread(bid, ask)

    csp.print('spread', s)
    csp.print('bid', bid)
    csp.print('ask', ask)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    csp.run(my_graph, starttime=datetime.utcnow())
```

In this simple example `my_graph` is defined as a `csp.graph` component.
This method will be called once by `csp.run` in order to construct the graph.
`csp.const` defines a constant value as a timeseries which will tick once upon startup (this is effectively an input).

`bid = csp.multiply(bid, csp.const(4))` will insert a `csp.multiply` node to do timeseries multiplication.
`bid` and `ask` are then connected to the user defined `csp.node` `spread`.
`bid`/`ask` and the calculated `spread` are then linked to the `csp.print` output to print the results.

In order to help visualize this graph, you can call `csp.show_graph`:

The result of this would be:

```
2020-04-02 15:33:38.256724 bid:4.0
2020-04-02 15:33:38.256724 ask:6.0
2020-04-02 15:33:38.256724 spread:2.0
```

## Anatomy of a csp.node

The heart of a calculation graph are the csp.nodes that run the computations.
`csp.node` methods can take any number of scalar and timeseries arguments, and can return 0 → N timeseries outputs.
Timeseries inputs/outputs should be thought of as the edges that connect components of the graph.
These "edges" can tick whenever they have a new value.
Every tick is associated with a value and the time of the tick.
csp.nodes can have various other features, here is a an example of a csp.node that demonstrates many of the features.
Keep in mind that nodes will execute repeatedly as inputs tick with new data.
They may (or may not) generate an output as a result of an input tick.

```python
from datetime import timedelta

@csp.node                                                                # 1
def demo_node(n: int, xs: ts[float], ys: ts[float]) -> ts[float]:        # 2
    with csp.alarms():                                                   # 3
        # Define an alarm time-series of type bool                       # 4
        alarm = csp.alarm(bool)                                          # 5 
                                                                         # 6
    with csp.state():                                                    # 7
        # Create a state variable bound to the node                      # 8
        s_sum = 0.0                                                      # 9
                                                                         # 10
    with csp.start():                                                    # 11
        # Code block that executes once on start of the engine           # 12
        # one can set timeseries properties here as well, such as        # 13
        # csp.set_buffering_policy(xs, tick_count=5)                     # 14
        # csp.set_buffering_policy(xs, tick_history=timedelta(minutes=1))# 15
        # csp.make_passive(xs)                                           # 16
        csp.schedule_alarm(alarm, timedelta(seconds=1), True)            # 17
                                                                         # 18
    with csp.stop():                                                     # 19
        pass  # code block to execute when the engine is done            # 20
                                                                         # 21
    if csp.ticked(xs, ys) and csp.valid(xs, ys):                         # 22
        s_sum += xs * ys                                                 # 23
                                                                         # 24
    if csp.ticked(alarm):                                                # 25
        csp.schedule_alarm(alarm, timedelta(seconds=1), True)            # 26
        return s_sum                                                     # 27
```

Lets review line by line

1\) Every csp node must start with the **`@csp.node`** decorator

2\) `csp` nodes are fully typed and type-checking is strictly enforced.
All arguments must be typed, as well as all outputs.
Outputs are typed using function annotation syntax.

Single outputs can be unnamed, for multiple outputs they must be named.
When using multiple outputs, annotate the type using **`def my_node(inputs) → csp.Outputs(name1=ts[<T>], name2=ts[<V>])`** where `T` and `V` are the respective types of `name1` and `name2`.

Note the syntax of timeseries inputs, they are denoted by **`ts[type]`**.
Scalars can be passed in as regular types, in this example we pass in `n` which expects a type of `int`

3\) **`with csp.alarms()`**: nodes can (optionally) declare internal alarms, every instance of the node will get its own alarm that can be scheduled and act just like a timeseries input.
All alarms must be declared within the alarms context.

5\) Instantiate an alarm in the alarms context using the `csp.alarm(typ)` function. This creates an alarm which is a time-series of type `typ`.

7\) **`with csp.state()`**: optional state variables can be defined under the state context.
Note that variables declared in state will live across invocations of the method.

9\) An example declaration and initialization of state variable `s_sum`.
It is good practice to name state variables prefixed with `s_`, which is the convention in the `csp` codebase.

11\) **`with csp.start()`**: an optional block to execute code at the start of the engine.
Generally this is used to setup initial timers or set input timeseries properties such as buffer sizes, or to make inputs passive

14-15) **`csp.set_buffering_policy`**: nodes can request a certain amount of history be kept on the incoming time series, this can be denoted in number of ticks or in time.
By setting a buffering policy, nodes can access historical values of the timeseries (by default only the last value is kept)

16\) **`csp.make_passive`** / **`csp.make_active`**: Nodes may not need to react to all of their inputs, they may just need their latest value.
For performance purposes the node can mark an input as passive to avoid triggering the node unnecessarily.
`make_active` can be called to reactivate an input.

17\) **`csp.schedule_alarm`**: scheduled a one-shot tick on the given alarm input.
The values given are the timedelta before the alarm triggers and the value it will have when it triggers.
Note that `schedule_alarm` can be called multiple times on the same alarm to schedule multiple triggers.

19\) **`with csp.stop()`** is an optional block that can be called when the engine is done running.

22\) all nodes will have if conditions to react to different inputs.
**`csp.ticked()`** takes any number of inputs and returns true if **any** of the inputs ticked.
**`csp.valid`** similar takes any number of inputs however it only returns true if **all** inputs are valid.
Valid means that an input has had at least one tick and so it has a "current value".

23\) One of the benefits of `csp` is that you always have easy access to the latest value of all inputs.
`xs` and `ys` on line 22,23 will always have the latest value of both inputs, even if only one of them just ticked.

25\) This demonstrates how an alarm can be treated like any other input.

27\) We tick our running "sum" as an output here every second.

## Basket inputs

In addition to single time-series inputs, a node can also accept a **basket** of time series as an argument.
A basket is essentially a collection of timeseries which can be passed in as a single argument.
Baskets can either be list baskets or dict baskets.
Individual timeseries in a basket can tick independently, and they can be looked at and reacted to individually or as a collection.

For example:

```python
@csp.node                                      # 1
def demo_basket_node(                          # 2
    list_basket: [ts[int]],                    # 3
    dict_basket: {str: ts[int]}                # 4
) -> ts[float]:                                # 5
                                               # 6
    if csp.ticked(list_basket):                # 7
        return sum(list_basket.validvalues())  # 8
                                               # 9
    if csp.ticked(list_basket[3]):             # 10
        return list_basket[3]                  # 11
                                               # 12
    if csp.ticked(dict_basket):                # 13
        # can iterate over ticked key,items    # 14
        # for k,v in dict_basket.tickeditems():# 15
        #     ...                              # 16
        return sum(dict_basket.tickedvalues()) # 17
```

3\) Note the syntax of basket inputs.
list baskets are noted as `[ts[type]]` (a list of time series) and dict baskets are `{key_type: ts[ts_type]}` (a dictionary of timeseries keyed by type `key_type`).

7\) Just like single timeseries, we can react to a basket if it ticked.
The convention is the same as passing multiple inputs to `csp.ticked`, `csp.ticked` is true if **any** basket input ticked.
`csp.valid` is true is **all** basket inputs are valid.

8\) baskets have various iterators to access their inputs:

- **`tickedvalues`**: iterator of values of all ticked inputs
- **`tickedkeys`**: iterator of keys of all ticked inputs (keys are list index for list baskets)
- **`tickeditems`**: iterator of (key,value) tuples of ticked inputs
- **`validvalues`**: iterator of values of all valid inputs
- **`validkeys`**: iterator of keys of all valid inputs
- **`validitems`**: iterator of (key,value) tuples of valid inputs
- **`keys`**: list of keys on the basket (**dictionary baskets only** )

10-11) This demonstrates the ability to access an individual element of a
basket and react to it as well as access its current value

## **Node Outputs**

Nodes can return any number of outputs (including no outputs, in which case it is considered an "output" or sink node,
see [Graph Pruning](https://github.com/Point72/csp/wiki/0.-Introduction#graph-pruning)).
Nodes with single outputs can return the output as an unnamed output.
Nodes returning multiple outputs must have them be named.
When a node is called at graph building time, if its is a single unnamed node the return variable is an edge representing the output which can be passed into other nodes.
If the outputs are named, the return value is an object with the outputs available as attributes.
For example (examples below demonstrate various ways to output the data as well)

```python
@csp.node
def single_unnamed_outputs(n: ts[int]) -> ts[int]:
    # can either do
    return n
    # or
    # csp.output(n) to continue processes after output


@csp.node
def multiple_named_outputs(n: ts[int]) -> csp.Outputs(y=ts[int], z=ts[float]):
    # can do
    # csp.output(y=n, z=n+1.) to output to multiple outputs
    # or separate the outputs to tick out at separate points:
    # csp.output(y=n)
    # ...
    # csp.output(z=n+1.)
    # or can return multiple values with:
    return csp.output(y=n, z=n+1.)

@csp.graph
def my_graph(n: ts[int]):
    x = single_unnamed_outputs(n)
    # x represents the output edge of single_unnamed_outputs,
    # we can pass it a time series input to other nodes
    csp.print('x', x)


    result = multiple_named_outputs(n)
    # result holds all the outputs of multiple_named_outputs, which can be accessed as attributes
    csp.print('y', result.y)
    csp.print('z', result.z)
```

## Basket Outputs

Similarly to inputs, a node can also produce a basket of timeseries as an output.
For example:

```python
class MyStruct(csp.Struct):            # 1
    symbol: str                        # 2
    index: int                         # 3
    value: float                       # 4
                                       # 5
@csp.node                              # 6
def demo_basket_output_node(           # 7
    in_: ts[MyStruct],                 # 8
    symbols: [str],                    # 9
    num_symbols: int                   # 10
) -> csp.Outputs(                      # 11
    dict_basket=csp.OutputBasket(      # 12
        Dict[str, ts[float]],          # 13
        shape="symbols",               # 14
    ),                                 # 15
    list_basket=csp.OutputBasket(      # 16
        List[ts[float]],               # 17
        shape="num_symbols"            # 18
    ),                                 # 19
):                                     # 20
                                       # 21
    if csp.ticked(in_):                # 22
        # output to dict basket        # 23
        csp.output(dict_basket[in_.symbol], in_.value)
        # alternate output syntax, can output multiple keys at once
        # csp.output(dict_basket={in_.symbol: in_.value})
        # output to list basket
        csp.output(list_basket[in_.index], in_.value)
        # alternate output syntax, can output multiple keys at once
        # csp.output(list_basket={in_.index: in_.value})
```

11-20) Note the output declaration syntax.
A basket output can be either named or unnamed (both examples here are named), and its shape can be specified two ways.
The `shape` parameter is used with a scalar value that defines the shape of the basket, or the name of the scalar argument (a dict basket expects shape to be a list of keys. lists basket expects `shape` to be an `int`).
`shape_of` is used to take the shape of an input basket and apply it to the output basket.

23+) There are several choices for output syntax.
The following work for both list and dict baskets:

- `csp.output(basket={key: value, key2: value2, ...})`
- `csp.output(basket[key], value)`
- `csp.output({key: value}) # only works if the basket is the only output`

## Generic Types

`csp` supports syntax for generic types as well.
To denote a generic type we use a string (typically `'T'` is used) to denote a generic type.
When a node is called the type of the argument will get bound to the given type variable, and further inputs / outputs will be checked and bound to said typevar.
Note that the string syntax `'~T'` denotes the argument expects the *value* of a type, rather than a type itself:

```python
@csp.node
def sample(trigger: ts[object], x: ts['T']) -> ts['T']:
    '''will return current value of x on trigger ticks'''
    with csp.state():
        csp.make_passive(x)

    if csp.ticked(trigger) and csp.valid(x):
        return x


@csp.node
def const(value: '~T') -> ts['T']:
    ...
```

`sample` takes a timeseries of type `'T'` as an input, and returns a timeseries of type `'T'`.
This allows us to pass in a `ts[int]` for example, and get a `ts[int]` as an output, or `ts[bool]` → `ts[bool]`

`const` takes value as an *instance* of type `T`, and returns a timeseries of type `T`.
So we can call `const(5)` and get a `ts[int]` output, or `const('hello!')` and get a `ts[str]` output, etc...

## Engine Time

The `csp` engine always maintains its current view of time.
The current time of the engine can be accessed at any time within a csp.node by calling `csp.now()`

## Graph Propagation and Single-dispatch

The `csp` graph propagation algorithm ensures that all nodes are executed *once* per engine cycle, and in the correct order.
Correct order means, that all input dependencies of a given node are guaranteed to have been evaluated before a given node is executed.
Take this graph for example:

![359407953](https://github.com/Point72/csp/assets/3105306/d9416353-6755-4e37-8467-01da516499cf)

On a given cycle lets say the `bid` input ticks.
The `csp` engine will ensure that **`mid`** is executed, followed by **`spread`** and only once **`spread`**'s output is updated will **`quote`** be called.
When **`quote`** executes it will have the latest values of the `mid` and `spread` calc for this cycle.

## Graph Pruning

One should note a subtle optimization technique in `csp` graphs.
Any part of a graph that is created at graph building time, but is NOT connected to any output nodes, will be pruned from the graph and will not exist during runtime.
An output is defined as either an output adapter or a `csp.node` without any outputs of its own.
The idea here is that we can avoid doing work if it doesn't result in any output being generated.
In general its best practice for all csp.nodes to be \***side-effect free**, in other words they shouldn't mutate any state outside of the node.
Assuming all nodes are side-effect free, pruning the graph would not have any noticeable effects.

## Anatomy of a `csp.graph`

To reiterate, csp.graph methods are called in order to construct the graph and are only executed before the engine is run.
csp.graph methods don't do anything special, they are essentially regular python methods, but they can be defined to accept inputs and generate outputs similar to csp.nodes.
This is solely used for type checking.
csp.graph methods can be created to encapsulate components of a graph, and can be called from other csp.graph methods in order to help facilitate graph building.

Simple example:

```python
@csp.graph
def calc_symbol_pnl(symbol: str, trades: ts[Trade]) -> ts[float]:
    # sub-graph code needed to compute pnl for given symbol and symbol's trades
    # sub-graph can subscribe to market data for the symbol as needed
    ...


@csp.graph
def calc_portfolio_pnl(symbols: [str]) -> ts[float]:
    symbol_pnl = []
    for symbol in symbols:
        symbol_trades = trade_adapter.subscribe(symbol)
        symbol_pnl.append(calc_symbol_pnl(symbol, symbol_trades))

    return csp.sum(symbol_pnl)
```

In this simple example we have a csp.graph component `calc_symbol_pnl` which encapsulates computing pnl for a single symbol.
`calc_portfolio_pnl` is a graph that computes portfolio level pnl, it invokes the symbol-level pnl calc for every symbol, then sums up the results for the portfolio level pnl.

# Historical Buffers

`csp` provides access to historical input data as well.
By default only the last value of an input is kept in memory, however one can request history to be kept on an input either by number of ticks or by time using **csp.set_buffering_policy.**

The methods **csp.value_at**, **csp.time_at** and **csp.item_at** can be used to retrieve historical input values.
Each node should call **csp.set_buffering_policy** to make sure that its inputs are configured to store sufficiently long history for correct implementation.
For example, let's assume that we have a stream of data and we want to create equally sized buckets from the data.
A possible implementation of such a node would be:

```python
@csp.node
def data_bin_generator(bin_size: int, input: ts['T']) -> ts[['T']]:
    with csp.start():
        assert bin_size > 0
        # This makes sure that input stores at least bin_size entries
        csp.set_buffering_policy(input, tick_count=bin_size)
    if csp.ticked(input) and (csp.num_ticks(input) % bin_size == 0):
        return [csp.value_at(input, -i) for i in range(bin_size)]
```

In this example, we use **`csp.set_buffering_policy(input, tick_count=bin_size)`** to ensure that the buffer history contains at least **`bin_size`** elements.
Note that an input can be shared by multiple nodes, if multiple nodes provide size requirements, the buffer size would be resolved to the maximum size to support all requests.

Alternatively, **`csp.set_buffering_policy`** supports a **`timedelta`** parameter **`tick_history`** instead of **`tick_count`.**
If **`tick_history`** is provided, the buffer will scale dynamically to ensure that any period of length **`tick_history`** will fit into the history buffer.

To identify when there are enough samples to construct a bin we use **`csp.num_ticks(input) % bin_size == 0`**.
The function **`csp.num_ticks`** returns the number or total ticks for a given time series.
NOTE: The actual size of the history buffer is usually less than **`csp.num_ticks`** as buffer is dynamically truncated to satisfy the set policy.

The past values in this example are accessed using **`csp.value_at`**.
The various historical access methods take the same arguments and return the value, time and tuple of `(time,value)` respectively:

- **`csp.value_at`**`(ts, index_or_time, duplicate_policy=DuplicatePolicy.LAST_VALUE, default=UNSET)`: returns **value** at requested `index_or_time`
- **`csp.time_at`**`(ts, index_or_time, duplicate_policy=DuplicatePolicy.LAST_VALUE, default=UNSET)`: returns **datetime** at requested `index_or_time`
- **`csp.item_at`**`(ts, index_or_time, duplicate_policy=DuplicatePolicy.LAST_VALUE, default=UNSET)`: returns tuple of `(datetime,value)` at requested `index_or_time`
  - **`ts`**: the name of the input
  - **`index_or_time`**:
    - If providing an **index**, this represents how many ticks back to rereieve **and should be \<= 0**.
      0 indicates the current value, -1 is the previous value, etc.
    - If providing **time** one can either provide a datetime for absolute time, or a timedelta for how far back to access.
      **NOTE** that timedelta must be negative to represent time in the past..
  - **`duplicate_policy`**: when requesting history by datetime or timedelta, its possible that there could be multiple values that match the given time.
    **`duplicate_policy`** can be provided to control the behavior of what to return in this case.
    The default policy is to return the LAST_VALUE that exists at the given time.
  - **`default`**: value to be returned if the requested time is out of the history bounds (if default is not provided and a request is out of bounds an exception will be raised).

To illustrate the usage of history access using the **timedelta** indexing, consider a possible implementation of a function that sums up samples taken every second for each periods of **n_seconds** of the input time series.
If the value ticks slower than every second then this implementation could sample the same value more than once (this is just an illustration, it's NOT recommended to use such implementation in real application as it could be implemented more efficiently):

```python
@csp.node
def sample_sum(n_seconds: int, input: ts[int], default_sample_value: int = 0) -> ts[int]:
    with csp.alarms():
        a = csp.alarm(bool)
    with csp.start():
        assert n_seconds > 0
        # This makes sure that input stores at least n_seconds seconds
        csp.set_buffering_policy(input, tick_history=timedelta(seconds=n_seconds))
        # Flag the input as passive since we don't need to react to its ticks
        csp.make_passive(input)
        # Schedule the first sample in n_seconds-1 from start, to also capture the initial value
        csp.schedule_alarm(a, timedelta(seconds=n_seconds - 1), True)
    if csp.ticked(a):
        # Schedule the next sample in n_seconds from start
        csp.schedule_alarm(a, timedelta(seconds=n_seconds), True)
        res = 0
        for i in range(n_seconds):
            res += csp.value_at(input, timedelta(seconds=-i), default=default_sample_value)
        return res
```

## Historical Range Access

In similar fashion, the methods **`csp.values_at`**, **`csp.times_at`** and **`csp.items_at`** can be used to retrieve a range of historical input values as numpy arrays.
The bin generator example above can be accomplished more efficiently with range access:

```python
@csp.node
def data_bin_generator(bin_size: int, input: ts['T']) -> ts[['T']]:
    with csp.start():
        assert bin_size > 0
        # This makes sure that input stores at least bin_size entries
        csp.set_buffering_policy(input, tick_count=bin_size)
    if csp.ticked(input) and (csp.num_ticks(input) % bin_size == 0):
        return csp.values_at(input, -bin_size + 1, 0).tolist()
```

The past values in this example are accessed using **`csp.values_at`**.
The various historical access methods take the same arguments and return the value, time and tuple of `(times,values)` respectively:

- **`csp.values_at`**`(ts, start_index_or_time, end_index_or_time, start_index_policy=TimeIndexPolicy.INCLUSIVE, end_index_policy=TimeIndexPolicy.INCLUSIVE)`:
  returns values in specified range as a numpy array
- **`csp.times_at`**`(ts, start_index_or_time, end_index_or_time, start_index_policy=TimeIndexPolicy.INCLUSIVE, end_index_policy=TimeIndexPolicy.INCLUSIVE)`:
  returns times in specified range as a numpy array
- **`csp.items_at`**`(ts, start_index_or_time, end_index_or_time, start_index_policy=TimeIndexPolicy.INCLUSIVE, end_index_policy=TimeIndexPolicy.INCLUSIVE)`:
  returns a tuple of (times, values) numpy arrays
  - **`ts`** - the name of the input
  - **`start_index_or_time`**:
    - If providing an **index**, this represents how many ticks back to retrieve **and should be \<= 0**.
      0 indicates the current value, -1 is the previous value, etc.
    - If providing  **time** one can either provide a datetime for absolute time, or a timedelta for how far back to access.
      **NOTE that timedelta must be negative** to represent time in the past..
    - If **None** is provided, the range will begin "from the beginning" - i.e., the oldest tick in the buffer.
  - **end_index_or_time:** same as start_index_or_time
    - If **None** is provided, the range will go "until the end" - i.e., the newest tick in the buffer.
  - **`start_index_policy`**: only for use with datetime/timedelta as the start and end parameters.
    - **\`TimeIndexPolicy.INCLUSIVE**: if there is a tick exactly at the requested time, include it
    - **TimeIndexPolicy.EXCLUSIVE**: if there is a tick exactly at the requested time, exclude it
    - **TimeIndexPolicy.EXTRAPOLATE**: if there is a tick at the beginning timestamp, include it.
      Otherwise, if there is a tick before the beginning timestamp, force a tick at the beginning timestamp with the prevailing value at the time.
  - **end_index_policy** only for use with datetime/timedelta and the start and end parameters.
    - **TimeIndexPolicy.INCLUSIVE**: if there is a tick exactly at the requested time, include it
    - **TimeIndexPolicy.EXCLUSIVE**: if there is a tick exactly at the requested time, exclude it
    - **TimeIndexPolicy.EXTRAPOLATE**: if there is a tick at the end timestamp, include it.
      Otherwise, if there is a tick before the end timestamp, force a tick at the end timestamp with the prevailing value at the time

Range access is optimized at the C++ layer and for this reason its far more efficient than calling the single value access methods in a loop, and they should be substituted in where possible.

Below is a rolling average example to illustrate the use of timedelta indexing.
Note that `timedelta(seconds=-n_seconds)` is equivalent to `csp.now() - timedelta(seconds=n_seconds)`, since datetime indexing is supported.

```python
@csp.node
def rolling_average(x: ts[float], n_seconds: int) -> ts[float]:
    with csp.start():
        assert n_seconds > 0
        csp.set_buffering_policy(x, tick_history=timedelta(seconds=n_seconds))
    if csp.ticked(x):
        avg = np.mean(csp.values_at(x, timedelta(seconds=-n_seconds), timedelta(seconds=0),
                                      csp.TimeIndexPolicy.INCLUSIVE, csp.TimeIndexPolicy.INCLUSIVE))
        csp.output(avg)
```

When accessing all elements within the buffering policy window like
this, it would be more succinct to pass None as the start and end time,
but datetime/timedelta allows for more general use (e.g. rolling average
between 5 seconds and 1 second ago, or average specifically between
9:30:00 and 10:00:00)

# Cyclical graph - `csp.feedback`

By definition of the graph building code, csp graphs can only produce acyclical graphs.
However, there are many occasions where a cycle may be required.
For example, lets say you want part of your graph to simulate an exchange.
That part of the graph would need to accept new orders and return acks and executions.
However, the acks / executions would likely need to *feedback* into the same part of the graph that generated the orders.
For this reason, the `csp.feedback` construct exists.
Using `csp.feedback` one can wire a feedback as an input to a node, and effectively bind the actual edge that feeds it later in the graph.
Note that internally the graph is still acyclical.
Internally `csp.feedback` creates a pair of output and input adapters that are bound together.
When a timeseries that is bound to a feedback ticks, it is fed to the feedback which then schedules the tick on its bound input to be executed on the **next engine cycle**.
The next engine cycle will execute with the same engine time as the cycle that generated it, but it will be evaluated in a subsequent cycle.

- **`csp.feedback(ts_type)`**: `ts_type` is the type of the timeseries (ie int, str).
  This returns an instance of a feedback object
  - **`out()`**: this method returns the timeseries edge which can be passed as an input to your node
  - **`bind(ts)`**: this method is called to bind an edge as the source of the feedback after the fact

A simple example should help demonstrate a possible usage.
Lets say we want to simulate acking orders that are generated from a node called `my_algo`.
In addition to generating the orders, `my_algo` also wants needs to receive the execution reports (this is demonstrated in example `e_13_feedback.py`)

The graph code would look something like this:

```python
# Simulate acking an order
@csp.node
def my_exchange(order:ts[Order]) -> ts[ExecReport]:
    # ... impl details ...

@csp.node
def my_algo(exec_report:ts[ExecReport]) -> ts[Order]:
    # .. impl details ...

@csp.graph
def my_graph():
    # create the feedback first so that we can refer to it later
    exec_report_fb = csp.feedback(ExecReport)

    # generate orders, passing feedback out() which isn't bound yet
    orders = my_algo(exec_report_fb.out())

    # get exec_reports from "simulator"
    exec_report = my_exchange(orders)

    # now bind the exec reports to the feedback, finishing the "loop"
    exec_report_fb.bind(exec_report)
```

The graph would end up looking like this.
It remains acyclical, but the `FeedbackOutputDef` is bound to the `FeedbackInputDef` here, any tick to out will push the tick to in on the next cycle:

# Collecting Graph Outputs

If the `csp.graph` passed to `csp.run` has outputs, the full timeseries will be returned from `csp.run` like so:

**outputs example**

```python
import csp
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@csp.graph
def my_graph() -> ts[int]:
    return csp.merge(csp.const(1), csp.const(2, timedelta(seconds=1)))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    res = csp.run(my_graph, starttime=datetime(2021,11,8))
    print(res)
```

result:

```raw
{0: [(datetime.datetime(2021, 11, 8, 0, 0), 1), (datetime.datetime(2021, 11, 8, 0, 0, 1), 2)]}
```

Note that the result is a list of `(datetime, value)` tuples.

You can also use [csp.add_graph_output](<https://github.com/Point72/csp/wiki/1.-Generic-Nodes-(csp.baselib)#adapters>) to add outputs.
These do not need to be in the top-level graph called directly from `csp.run`.

This gives the same result:

**add_graph_output example**

```python
@csp.graph
def my_graph():
    csp.add_graph_output('a', csp.merge(csp.const(1), csp.const(2, timedelta(seconds=1))))
```

In addition to python outputs like above, you can set the optional `csp.run` argument `output_numpy` to `True` to get outputs as numpy arrays:

**numpy outputs**

```python
result = csp.run(my_graph, starttime=datetime(2021,11,8), output_numpy=True)
```

result:

```raw
{0: (array(['2021-11-08T00:00:00.000000000', '2021-11-08T00:00:01.000000000'], dtype='datetime64[ns]'), array([1, 2], dtype=int64))}
```

Note that the result there is a tuple per output, containing two numpy arrays, one with the datetimes and one with the values.

# Realtime / Simulation Modes

The `csp` engine can be run in two flavors, realtime and simulation.

In simulation mode, the engine is always run at full speed pulling in time-based data from its input adapters and running them through the graph.
All inputs in simulation are driven off the provided timestamped data of its inputs.

In realtime mode, the engine runs in wallclock time as of "now".
Realtime engines can get data from realtime adapters which source data on separate threads and pass them through to the engine (ie think of activeMQ events happening on an activeMQ thread and being passed along to the engine in "realtime").

Since engines can run in both simulated and realtime mode, users should **always** use **`csp.now()`** to get the current time in csp.nodes

## Simulation Mode

Simulation mode is the default mode of the engine.
As stated above, simulation mode is used when you want your engine to crunch through historical data as fast as possible.
In simulation mode, the engine runs on some historical data that is fed in through various adapters.
The adapters provide events by time, and they are streamed into the engine via the adapter timeseries in time order.
csp.timer and csp.node alarms are scheduled and executed in "historical time" as well.
Note that there is no strict requirement for simulated runs to run on historical dates.
As long as the engine is not in realtime mode, it remains in simulation mode until the provided endtime, even if endtime is in the future.

## Realtime Mode

Realtime mode is opted into by passing `realtime=True` to `csp.run(...)`.
When run in realtime mode, the engine will run in simulation mode from the provided starttime → wallclock "now" as of the time of calling run.
Once the simulation run is done, the engine switches into realtime mode.
Under realtime mode, external realtime adapters will be able to send data into the engine thread.
All time based inputs such as csp.timer and alarms will switch to executing in wallclock time as well.

As always, `csp.now()` should still be used in csp.node code, even when running in realtime mode.
`csp.now()` will be the time assigned to the current engine cycle.

## csp.PushMode

When consuming data from input adapters there are three choices on how one can consume the data:

| PushMode       | EngineMode | Description |
| :-------       | :--------- | :---------- |
| **LAST_VALUE** | Simulation | all ticks from input source with duplicate timestamps (on the same timeseries) will tick once with the last value on a given timestamp |
|           | Realtime   | all ticks that occurred since previous engine cycle will collapse / conflate to the latest value |
| **NON_COLLAPSING** | Simulation | all ticks from input source with duplicate timestamps (on the same timeseries) will tick once per engine cycle. subsequent cycles will execute with the same time |
|           | Realtime | all ticks that occurred since previous engine cycle will be ticked across subsequent engine cycles as fast as possible |
| **BURST**      | Simulation | all ticks from input source with duplicate timestamps (on the same timeseries) will tick once with a list of all values |
|           | Realtime | all ticks that occurred since previous engine cycle will tick once with a list of all the values |

## Realtime Group Event Synchronization

The `csp` framework supports properly synchronizing events across multiple timeseries that are sourced from the same realtime adapter.
A classical example of this is a market data feed.
Say you consume bid, ask and trade as 3 separate time series for the same product / exchange.
Since the data flows in asynchronously from a separate thread, bid, ask and trade events could end up executing in the engine at arbitrary slices of time, leading to crossed books and trades that are out of range of the bid/ask.
The engine can properly provide a correct synchronous view of all the inputs, regardless of their PushModes.
Its up to adapter implementations to determine which inputs are part of a synchronous "PushGroup".

Here's a classical example.
An Application wants to consume conflating bid/ask as LAST_VALUE but it doesn't want to conflate trades, so its consumed as NON_COLLAPSING.

Lets say we have this sequence of events on the actual market data feed's thread, coming in one the wire in this order.
The columns denote the time the callbacks come in off the market data thread.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Event</th>
<th>T</th>
<th>T+1</th>
<th>T+2</th>
<th>T+3</th>
<th>T+4</th>
<th>T+5</th>
<th>T+6</th>
</tr>
&#10;<tr>
<td><strong>BID</strong></td>
<td>100.00</td>
<td>100.01</td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td>99.97</td>
<td>99.98</td>
<td>99.99</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ASK</strong></td>
<td>100.02</td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td>100.03</td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td>100.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>TRADE</strong></td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td>100.02</td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td>100.03</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Without any synchronization you can end up with nonsensical views based on random timing.
Here's one such possibility (bid/ask are still LAST_VALUE, trade is NON_COLLAPSING).

Over here ET is engine time.
Lets assume engine had a huge delay and hasn't processed any data submitted above yet.
Without any synchronization, bid/ask would completely conflate, and trade would unroll over multiple engine cycles

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Event</th>
<th>ET</th>
<th>ET+1</th>
</tr>
&#10;<tr>
<td><strong>BID</strong></td>
<td>99.99</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ASK</strong></td>
<td>100.00</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>TRADE</strong></td>
<td>100.02</td>
<td>100.03</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

However, since market data adapters will group bid/ask/trade inputs together, the engine won't let bid/ask events advance ahead of trade events since trade is NON_COLLAPSING.
NON_COLLAPSING inputs will essentially act as a barrier, not allowing events ahead of the barrier tick before the barrier is complete.
Lets assume again that the engine had a huge delay and hasn't processed any data submitted above.
With proper barrier synchronizations the engine cycles would look like this under the same conditions:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Event</th>
<th>ET</th>
<th>ET+1</th>
<th>ET+2</th>
</tr>
&#10;<tr>
<td><strong>BID</strong></td>
<td>100.01</td>
<td>99.99</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ASK</strong></td>
<td>100.03</td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td>100.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>TRADE</strong></td>
<td>100.02</td>
<td>100.03</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note how the last ask tick of 100.00 got held up to a separate cycle (ET+2) so that trade could tick with the correct view of bid/ask at the time of the second trade (ET+1)

As another example, lets say the engine got delayed briefly at wire time T, so it was able to process T+1 data.
Similarly it got briefly delayed at time T+4 until after T+6.  The engine would be able to process all data at time T+1, T+2, T+3 and T+6, leading to this sequence of engine cycles.
The equivalent "wire time" is denoted in parenthesis

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Event</th>
<th>ET (T+1)</th>
<th>ET+1 (T+2)</th>
<th>ET+2 (T+3)</th>
<th>ET+3 (T+5)</th>
<th>ET+4 (T+6)</th>
</tr>
&#10;<tr>
<td><strong>BID</strong></td>
<td>100.01</td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td>99.97</td>
<td>99.99</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ASK</strong></td>
<td>100.02</td>
<td>100.03</td>
<td><br />
</td>
