`csp` is written in Python and C++ with Python and C++ build dependencies. While prebuilt wheels are provided for end users, it is also straightforward to build `csp` from either the Python [source distribution](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/source-distribution-format/) or the GitHub repository.

As a convenience, `csp` uses a `Makefile` for commonly used commands. You can print the main available commands by running `make` with no arguments

```bash
> make

build                          build the library
clean                          clean the repository
fix                            run autofixers
install                        install library
lint                           run lints
test                           run the tests
```

# Prerequisites

`csp` has a few system-level dependencies which you can install from your machine package manager. Other package managers like `conda`, `nix`, etc, should also work fine. Currently, `csp` relies on the `GNU` compiler toolchain only.

# Building with Conda on Linux

The easiest way to get started on a Linux machine is by installing the necessary dependencies in a self-contained conda environment.

Tweak this script to create a conda environment, install the build dependencies, build, and install a development version of `csp` into the environment. Note that we use [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) in this example, but [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html), [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), etc, should all work fine.

## Install Conda

```bash
# download and install micromamba for Linux/Mac
"${SHELL}" <(curl -L micro.mamba.pm/install.sh)

# on windows powershell
# Invoke-Expression ((Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://micro.mamba.pm/install.ps1).Content)
```

## Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Point72/csp.git
cd csp
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Install build dependencies

```bash
# Note the operating system, change as needed
# Linux and MacOS should use the unix dev environment spec
micromamba create -n csp -f conda/dev-environment-unix.yml
micromamba activate csp
```

## Build

```bash
make build-conda

# finally install into the csp conda environment
make develop
```

## A note about dependencies

In Conda, we pull our dependencies from the Conda environment by setting the environment variable `CSP_USE_VCPKG=0`. This will force the build to not pull dependencies from vcpkg. This may or may not work in other environments or with packages provided by other package managers or built from source, but there is too much variability for us to support alternative patterns.

# Building with a system package manager

## Clone

Clone the repo and submodules with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Point72/csp.git
cd csp
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Install build dependencies

### Linux

**Debian/Ubuntu/etc**

```bash
# for vcpkg
sudo make dependencies-debian
# or
# sudo apt-get install -y automake bison cmake curl flex ninja-build tar unzip zip

# for g++
sudo apt install build-essential
```

**Fedora/RedHat/Centos/Rocky/Alma/etc**

```bash
# for vcpkg
sudo make dependencies-fedora
# or
# yum install -y automake bison cmake curl flex perl-IPC-Cmd tar unzip zip

# for g++
sudo dnf group install "Development Tools"
```

### MacOS

**Homebrew**

```bash
# for vcpkg
make dependencies-mac
# or
# brew install bison cmake flex make ninja
```

## Install Python dependencies

Python build and develop dependencies are specified in the `pyproject.toml`, but you can manually install them:

```bash
make requirements

# or
# python -m pip install toml
# python -m pip install `python -c 'import toml; c = toml.load("pyproject.toml"); print("\n".join(c["build-system"]["requires"]))'`
# python -m pip install `python -c 'import toml; c = toml.load("pyproject.toml"); print("\n".join(c["project"]["optional-dependencies"]["develop"]))'`
```

Note that these dependencies would otherwise be installed normally as part of [PEP517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) / [PEP518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/).

## Build

Build the python project in the usual manner:

```bash
make build

# on aarch64 linux, comment the above command and use this instead
# VCPKG_FORCE_SYSTEM_BINARIES=1 make build

# or
# python setup.py build build_ext --inplace
```

### Building on `aarch64` Linux

On `aarch64` Linux the VCPKG_FORCE_SYSTEM_BINARIES environment variable must be set before running `make build`:

```bash
VCPKG_FORCE_SYSTEM_BINARIES=1 make build
```

## Using System Dependencies

By default, we pull and build dependencies with [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/). We only support non-vendored dependencies via Conda (see [A note about dependencies](#A-note-about-dependencies) above).

# Lint and Autoformat

`csp` has listing and auto formatting.

| Language | Linter | Autoformatter | Description |
| :------- | :----- | :------------ | :---------- |
| C++      | `clang-format` | `clang-format` | Style |
| Python   | `ruff`         | `ruff` | Style |
| Python   | `isort`         | `isort` | Imports |
| Markdown | `mdformat` / `codespell` | `mdformat` / `codespell` | Style/Spelling |

**C++ Linting**

```bash
make lint-cpp
# or
# clang-format --dry-run -Werror -i -style=file `find ./cpp/ -name "*.*pp"`
```

**C++ Autoformatting**

```bash
make fix-cpp
# or
# clang-format -i -style=file `find ./cpp/ -name "*.*pp"`
```

**Python Linting**

```bash
make lint-py
# or
# python -m isort --check csp/ setup.py
# python -m ruff check csp/ setup.py
```

**Python Autoformatting**

```bash
make fix-py
# or
# python -m isort csp/ setup.py
# python -m ruff format csp/ setup.py
```

**Documentation Linting**

```bash
make lint-docs
# or
# python -m mdformat --check docs/wiki/ README.md examples/README.md
# python -m codespell_lib docs/wiki/ README.md examples/README.md
```

**Documentation Autoformatting**

```bash
make fix-docs
# or
# python -m mdformat docs/wiki/ README.md examples/README.md
# python -m codespell_lib --write docs/wiki/ README.md examples/README.md
```

# Testing

`csp` has both Python and C++ tests. The bulk of the functionality is tested in Python, which can be run via `pytest`. First, install the Python development dependencies with

```bash
make develop
```

For full test coverage including certain adapters and integration/regression tests, you will need to install some additional dependencies and spin up some services. These dependencies include:

- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/): for generating static diagrams of graph structure
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/): for spinning up self-contained services against which to integration-test adapters

On Debian/Ubuntu Linux, run

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y graphviz
```

On Fedora/RedHat/Centos/Rocky/Alma/etc, run

```bash
yum install -y graphviz
```

On MacOS using Homebrew, run

```bash
brew install graphviz
```

**Python**

```bash
make test-py
# or
# python -m pytest -v csp/tests --junitxml=junit.xml

make coverage-py
# or python -m pytest -v csp/tests --junitxml=junit.xml --cov=csp --cov-report xml --cov-report html --cov-branch --cov-fail-under=80 --cov-report term-missing
```

Adapters might rely on external services. For example, the `kafka` adapter requires a cluster against which to test. We rely on [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for these services. We store docker compose files in the `ci` directory, and convenience `Makefile` commands are available:

```bash
make dockerup ADAPTER=kafka
# or
# docker compose -f ci/kafka/docker-compose.yml up -d

make dockerps ADAPTER=kafka
# or
# docker compose -f ci/kafka/docker-compose.yml ps

make dockerdown ADAPTER=kafka
# or
# docker compose -f ci/kafka/docker-compose.yml down
```

Note that tests may be skipped by default, so run with:

```bash
CSP_TEST_KAFKA=1 make test
# or
# CSP_TEST_KAFKA=1 python -m pytest -v csp/tests --junitxml=junit.xml
```

There are a few test flags available:

- **`CSP_TEST_KAFKA`**
- **`CSP_TEST_SKIP_EXAMPLES`**: skip tests of examples folder

# Troubleshooting

## MacOS

### vcpkg install failed

Check the `vcpkg-manifest-install.log` files, and install the corresponding packages if needed.

For example, you may need to `brew install pkg-config`.

### Building thrift:arm64-osx/thrift:x64-osx failed

```
Thrift requires bison > 2.5, but the default `/usr/bin/bison` is version 2.3.
```

Ensure the homebrew-installed bison (version >= 3.8) is **before** `/usr/bin/bison` on $PATH

On ARM: `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"`

On Intel: `export PATH="/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"`

### CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "Unix Makefiles".

Complete error message:

```bash
CMake Error: CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "Unix Makefiles".  CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set.  You probably need to select a different build tool.
CMake Error: CMAKE_C_COMPILER not set, after EnableLanguage
```

`vcpkg-manifest-install.log`:

```bash
CMake Error at scripts/cmake/vcpkg_execute_build_process.cmake:134
```

`install-arm64-osx-dbg-out.log`:

```bash
ld: Assertion failed: (resultIndex < sectData.atoms.size()), function findAtom, file Relocations.cpp, line 1336.
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

This is a known bug: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/145991

Retry the build with `CXXFLAGS='-Wl,-ld_classic'`.

Apple Silicon (ARM):

```bash
