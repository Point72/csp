CSP (Composable Stream Processing) is a library for high-performance real-time event stream processing in Python.

## Key Features

- **Powerful C++ Engine:** Execute the graph using CSP's C++ Graph Processing Engine
- **Simulation (i.e., offline) mode:** Test workflows on historical data and quickly move to real-time data in deployment
- **Infrastructure-agnostic:** Connect to any data format or storage database, using built-in (Parquet, Kafka, etc.) or custom adapters
- **Highly-customizable:** Write your own input and output adapters for any data/storage formats, and real-time adapters for specific workflows
- **PyData interoperability:** Use your favorite libraries from the Scientific Python Ecosystem for numerical and statistical computations
- **Functional/declarative style:** Write concise and composable code for stream processing by building graphs in Python
