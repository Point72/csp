## Base Statistics

### Count

```python
count(
    x: ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]],
    interval: Union[timedelta, int] = None,
    min_window: Union[timedelta, int] = None,
    ignore_na: bool = True,
    trigger: ts[object] = None,
    sampler: ts[object] = None,
    reset: ts[object] = None,
    min_data_points: int = 0
) → ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]]
```

Args:

- **x**: the time-series data.
- **interval**: the rolling interval over which to use data.
  If unspecified or set to `None`, an expanding (unbounded) window will be used.
  - if an int, represents the number of ticks to use
  - if a timedelta, represents the time interval to keep data (non-inclusive at left endpoint)
- **min_window**: the minimum allowable interval to use before outputting data
  - If the interval is a timedelta then this must also be a timedelta. Example: interval=60s, min_window=30s means to use a 60s rolling interval with no output for the first 30s.
  - If the interval is a tick count then this must also be a tick count. Example: interval=100, min_window=50 means to use a 100-tick rolling interval with no output until we have 50 ticks
  - *By default,* the min_window is equal to the interval
- **ignore_na**: if `True`, ignores NaN values in the window (does not count them). If false, NaN values make the count NaN.
  - *By default*, `ignore_na` is True
- **trigger**: another optional time-series which can be used to externally trigger computations. Whenever the trigger ticks, the given statistic will be updated and returned.
  - *By default*, the trigger is the series itself.
- **sampler**: another optional time-series which specifies when x *should* tick. The behavior is as follows:
  - If x ticks \*and \*sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered valid and is used.
  - If x ticks but sampler does not tick, then the x tick is considered invalid and is ignored.
  - If x does not tick but sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered NaN and is handled based on the ignore_na flag.
  - *By default*, the sampler is the series itself.
- **reset**: another optional time-series which, when ticked, will clear all data in the interval and "reset" the calculation
  - *By default*, there is no reset series.
- **min_data_points**: the minimum number of valid (non-nan) data points that must exist in the interval for a calculation to be valid. If there are fewer than min_data_points, NaN is returned.

Returns:

- A time-series of how many data points are currently in the interval. If a tick count is used, then it is necessarily less than or equal to the interval.

#### Examples: `count`

Starttime: `2020-01-01 00:00:00`

**1. Default behavior**

```python
x = {'2020-01-01': 1, '2020-01-02': 2, '2020-01-03': 3, '2020-01-04': nan, '2020-01-05': 5}
count(x, interval=3)
```

```python
# NaN is not counted
{'2020-01-03': 3, '2020-01-04': 2, '2020-01-05': 2}
```

**2. Including NaN**

```python
count(x, interval=3, ignore_na=False)
```

```python
{'2020-01-03': 3, '2020-01-04': nan, '2020-01-05': nan}
```

**3. Triggering**

```python
trigger = {'2020-01-03': True, '2020-01-05': True}
count(x, interval=timedelta(days=3), min_window=timedelta(days=2), ignore_na=True, trigger=trigger)
```

```python
{'2020-01-03': 3, '2020-01-05': 2}
```

**4. Sampling**

```python
sampler = {'2020-01-01': True, '2020-01-02': True, '2020-01-03': True, '2020-01-05': True, '2020-01-06': True}
count(x, interval=timedelta(days=3), min_window=timedelta(days=2), sampler=sampler)
```

```python
{'2020-01-03': 3, '2020-01-05': 2}
```

**Note**: the x value at 2020-01-04 is ignored completely since sampler does not tick, while the value at 2020-01-06 is treated as NaN.

**5. Reset**

```python
reset = {'2020-01-04': True}
count(x, interval=timedelta(days=3), min_window=timedelta(days=2), reset=reset)
```

```python
{'2020-01-03': 3, '2020-01-04': 0, '2020-01-05': 1}
```

**Note**: the window data is reset at 2020-01-04, and its value is NaN, so the count is 0

**6. NumPy**

```python
x_np = {'2020-01-01': [1,1], '2020-01-02': [2,np.nan], '2020-01-03': [3,3]}
count(x_np, interval=3, min_window=1)
```

```python
{'2020-01-01': [1,1], '2020-01-02': [2,1], '2020-01-03': [3,2]} # count is per element
```

  - If the interval is a tick count then this must also be a tick count. Example: interval=100, min_window=50 means to use a 100-tick rolling interval with no output until we have 50 ticks
  - *By default,* the min_window is equal to the interval
- **trigger**: another optional time-series which can be use to externally trigger computations. Whenever the trigger ticks, the given statistic will be updated and returned.
  - *By default*, the trigger is the series itself.
- **sampler**: another optional time-series which specifies when x *should* tick. The behavior is as follows:
  - If x ticks \*and \*sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered valid and is used.
  - If x ticks but sampler does not tick, then the x tick is considered invalid and is ignored.
  - If x does not tick but sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered NaN and is handled based on the ignore_na flag.
  - *By default*, the sampler is the series itself.
- **reset**: another optional time-series which, when ticked, will clear all data in the interval and "reset" the calculation
  - *By default*, there is no reset series.
- **min_data_points**: the minimum number of valid (non-nan) data points that must exist in the interval for a calculation to be valid. If there are fewer than min_data_point, NaN is returned.
- **precision**: the decimal place precision at which two floats are considered non-unique. For example, if precision=2, then 2.001 and 2.002 would be considered non-unique.
  - *By default,* precision is set to 10 decimal places.

Returns:

- a time-series of how many unique (excluding nan) values are currently in the interval

x_np = {'2020-01-01': [1,1], '2020-01-02': [2,np.nan], '2020-01-03': [3,3]}
first(x_np, interval=2)
```

```python
# first non-nan value
{'2020-01-02': [1,1], '2020-01-03': [2,3]}
```

### Mean

```python
mean(
    x: ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]],
    interval: Union[timedelta, int] = None,
    min_window: Union[timedelta, int] = None,
    ignore_na: bool = True,
    trigger: ts[object] = None,
    weights: ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]] = None,
    sampler: ts[object] = None,
    reset: ts[object] = None,
    recalc: ts[object] = None,
    min_data_points: int = 0
) → ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]]
```

- **x**: the time-series data. Can either be a `ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]]` or a `ts[np.ndarray]`.
- **interval**: the rolling interval over which to use data. If unspecified or set to None, an expanding (unbounded) window will be used.
  - if an int, represents the number of ticks to use
  - if a timedelta, represents the time interval to keep data (non-inclusive at left endpoint)
- **min_window**: the minimum allowable interval to use before outputting data
  - If the interval is a timedelta then this must also be a timedelta. Example: interval=60s, min_window=30s means to use a 60s rolling interval with no output for the first 30s.
  - If the interval is a tick count then this must also be a tick count. Example: interval=100, min_window=50 means to use a 100-tick rolling interval with no output until we have 50 ticks
  - *By default,* the min_window is equal to the interval
- **ignore_na**: if True, does not include any nan values in the window. If false, nan values in the window will make the entire window value nan.
- **trigger**: another optional time-series which can be used to externally trigger computations. Whenever the trigger ticks, the given statistic will be updated and returned.
  - *By default*, the trigger is the series itself.
- **weights:** a time-series of weights for each observation in x, used to calculate a weighted mean (optional). Weights do not need to be normalized.
- **sampler**: another optional time-series which specifies when x *should* tick. The behavior is as follows:
  - If x ticks \*and \*sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered valid and is used.
  - If x ticks but sampler does not tick, then the x tick is considered invalid and is ignored.
  - If x does not tick but sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered NaN and is handled based on the ignore_na flag.
  - *By default*, the sampler is the series itself.
- **reset**: another optional time-series which, when ticked, will clear all data in the interval and "reset" the calculation
- **recalc**: another optional time-series which triggers a clean recalculation of the window statistic, and in doing so clears any accumulated floating-point error
- **min_data_points**: the minimum number of valid (non-nan) data points that must exist in the interval for a calculation to be valid. If there are fewer than min_data_point, NaN is returned.

Returns:

- a time-series of rolling means over the interval. Computation uses smart updating so overflow is not an issue, since no sums are kept

#### Examples: `mean`

See `gmean`

### Geometric Mean

gmean(
    x: ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]],
    interval: Union[timedelta, int] = None,

  - *By default,* the min_window is equal to the interval
- **ignore_na**: if True, does not include any nan values in the window. If false, nan values in the window will make the entire window value nan.

  - *By default*, the trigger is the series itself.
- **sampler**: another optional time-series which specifies when x *should* tick. The behavior is as follows:
  - If x ticks \*and \*sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered valid and is used.
  - If x ticks but sampler does not tick, then the x tick is considered invalid and is ignored.
  - If x does not tick but sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered NaN and is handled based on the ignore_na flag.
  - *By default*, the sampler is the series itself.
- **reset**: another optional time-series which, when ticked, will clear all data in the interval and "reset" the calculation
- **min_data_points**: the minimum number of valid (non-nan) data points that must exist in the interval for a calculation to be valid. If there are fewer than min_data_point, NaN is returned.

Returns:

- a time-series of rolling geometric means over the interval. Requires a strictly positive-valued input.

  - if a timedelta, represents the time interval to keep data (non-inclusive at left endpoint)
- **min_window**: the minimum allowable interval to use before outputting data
  - If the interval is a timedelta then this must also be a timedelta. Example: interval=60s, min_window=30s means to use a 60s rolling interval with no output for the first 30s.
  - If the interval is a tick count then this must also be a tick count. Example: interval=100, min_window=50 means to use a 100-tick rolling interval with no output until we have 50 ticks
- **return_most_recent:** if True, in the case of a tie, the most recent time will be returned. If false, the least recent time will be returned.
- **ignore_na**: if True, does not include any nan values in the window. If false, nan values in the window will make the entire window value nan.
- **trigger**: another optional time-series which can be used to externally trigger computations. Whenever the trigger ticks, the given statistic will be updated and returned.
  - *By default*, the trigger is the series itself.
- **sampler**: another optional time-series which specifies when x *should* tick. The behavior is as follows:
  - If x ticks \*and \*sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered valid and is used.
  - If x ticks but sampler does not tick, then the x tick is considered invalid and is ignored.
  - If x does not tick but sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered NaN and is handled based on the ignore_na flag.
  - *By default*, the sampler is the series itself.
- **reset**: another optional time-series which, when ticked, will clear all data in the interval and "reset" the calculation
- **min_data_points**: the minimum number of valid (non-nan) data points that must exist in the interval for a calculation to be valid. If there are fewer than min_data_point, NaN is returned.

Returns:

- a time-series of rolling argmax values over the interval, returned as a datetime or NumPy array of np.datetime64 objects.  If no data is present or NaN invalidation occurs, the default time '1970-1-1 00:00:00' is returned.

  - If the interval is a timedelta then this must also be a timedelta. Example: interval=60s, min_window=30s means to use a 60s rolling interval with no output for the first 30s.
  - If the interval is a tick count then this must also be a tick count. Example: interval=100, min_window=50 means to use 100-tick rolling interval with no output until we have 50 ticks
- **method**:  the method to use to rank groups of records
  that have the same value
  - **`"min"`**: the lowest rank in the group is returned i.e. if the window data is \[1,2,2,3\] and the last tick is 2, then rank=1
  - **`"max"`**: the highest rank in the group is returned i.e. if the window data is \[1,2,2,3\] and the last tick is 2, then rank=3
  - **`"avg"`**: the average rank in the group is returned i.e. if the window data is \[1,2,2,3\] and the last tick is 2, then rank=2

- **trigger**: another optional time-series which can be used to externally trigger computations. Whenever the trigger ticks, the given statistic will be updated and returned.
  - *By default*, the trigger is the series itself.
- **sampler**: another optional time-series which specifies when x *should* tick. The behavior is as follows:
  - If x ticks \*and \*sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered valid and is used.
  - If x ticks but sampler does not tick, then the x tick is considered invalid and is ignored.
  - If x does not tick but sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered NaN and is handled based on the ignore_na flag.
  - *By default*, the sampler is the series itself.
- **reset**: another optional time-series which, when ticked, will clear all data in the interval and "reset" the calculation
- **min_data_points**: the minimum number of valid (non-nan) data points that must exist in the interval for a calculation to be valid. If there are fewer than min_data_point, nan is returned.

  value to be ranked
  - **`"keep"`**: return a nan rank for a nan value
  - **`"last"`**: rank the last non-nan value present in the interval
  - *By* default, the "keep" option is used.
- *Output*: a time-series of rolling ranks over the interval,
  where a rank of 0 means that the current (last) ticked value is
  the smallest in the given interval.

rank(x_np, 3, 2)
```

```python
# Note how the second element at '2020-01-02' is 0, not 1, as by default the "min" method is used
{'2020-01-02': [1, 0], '2020-01-03': [1, 0]}
```

**3. "keep" vs "last" NaN option**

```python
x = {'2020-01-01': 1, '2020-01-02': 3, '2020-01-03': 2, '2020-01-04': nan, '2020-01-05': 4}

## Moment-Based Statistics

### Variance

```python
var(
    x: ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]],
    interval: Union[timedelta, int] = None,
    min_window: Union[timedelta, int] = None,
    ddof: int = 1,
    ignore_na: bool = True,
    trigger: ts[object] = None,
    weights: ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]] = None,
    sampler: ts[object] = None,
    reset: ts[object] = None,
    recalc: ts[object] = None,
    min_data_points: int = 0
) → ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]]
```

Args:

- **x**: the time-series data
- **interval**: the rolling interval over which to use data. If unspecified or set to None, an expanding (unbounded) window will be used.
  - if an int, represents the number of ticks to use
  - if a timedelta, represents the time interval to keep data (non-inclusive at left endpoint)
- **min_window**: the minimum allowable interval to use before outputting data
  - If the interval is a timedelta then this must also be a timedelta. Example: interval=60s, min_window=30s means to use a 60s rolling interval with no output for the first 30s.
  - If the interval is a tick count then this must also be a tick count. Example: interval=100, min_window=50 means to use a 100-tick rolling interval with no output until we have 50 ticks
- **ddof:** delta degrees of freedom. Example: if ddof=1, then normalization term is 1/(N-1). If ddof=0, then 1/N.
- **ignore_na**: if True, does not include any nan values in the window. If false, nan values in the window will make the entire window value nan.
- **trigger**: another optional time-series which can be used to externally trigger computations. Whenever the trigger ticks, the given statistic will be updated and returned.
  - *By default*, the trigger is the series itself.
- **weights:** a time-series of weights for each observation in x, used to calculate a weighted variance (optional). Weights do not need to be normalized.
- **sampler**: another optional time-series which specifies when x *should* tick. The behavior is as follows:
  - If x ticks \*and \*sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered valid and is used.
  - If x ticks but sampler does not tick, then the x tick is considered invalid and is ignored.
  - If x does not tick but sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered NaN and is handled based on the ignore_na flag.
  - *By default*, the sampler is the series itself.
- **reset**: another optional time-series which, when ticked, will clear all data in the interval and "reset" the calculation
- **recalc**: another optional time-series which triggers a clean recalculation of the window statistic, and in doing so clears any accumulated floating-point error
- **min_data_points**: the minimum number of valid (non-nan) data points that must exist in the interval for a calculation to be valid. If there are fewer than min_data_point, NaN is returned.

Returns:

- a time-series of rolling variance over the interval. If insufficient samples for given ddof, then no value output is generated. Since the smart mean is being used, overflow is not a problem.

  - if a timedelta, represents the time interval to keep data (non-inclusive at left endpoint)
- **min_window**: the minimum allowable interval to use before outputting data
  - If the interval is a timedelta then this must also be a timedelta. Example: interval=60s, min_window=30s means to use a 60s rolling interval with no output for the first 30s.
  - If the interval is a tick count then this must also be a tick count. Example: interval=100, min_window=50 means to use a 100-tick rolling interval with no output until we have 50 ticks
- **ignore_na**: if True, does not include any nan values in the window. If false, nan values in the window will make the entire window value nan.
- **bias:** if True, calculates a biased (unadjusted) skew. If false (default), calculates a Gaussian-unbiased measure.

- **weights:** a time-series of weights for each observation in x, used to calculate a weighted skew (optional). Weights do not need to be normalized.
- **sampler**: another optional time-series which specifies when x *should* tick. The behavior is as follows:
  - If x ticks \*and \*sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered valid and is used.
  - If x ticks but sampler does not tick, then the x tick is considered invalid and is ignored.
  - If x does not tick but sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered NaN and is handled based on the ignore_na flag.

## Exponential Moving Statistics

### Exponential Moving Average

```python
ema(
    x: ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]],
    min_periods: int = 1,
    alpha: Optional[float] = None,
    span: Optional[float] = None,
    com: Optional[float] = None,
    halflife: Optional[timedelta] = None,
    adjust: bool = True,
    horizon: int = None,
    ignore_na: bool = False,
    trigger: ts[object] = None,
    sampler: ts[object] = None,
    reset: ts[object] = None,
    recalc: ts[object] = None,
    min_data_points: int = 0
) → ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]]
```

Args:

- **x**: the time-series data

- **min_periods**: the minimum allowable number of ticks to use before outputting data. The default is 1 for any EMA function.

- **alpha**: the EMA weight parameter specified directly.
  If *adjust = True,* EMA is calculated such that

  $$EMA(t) = \\frac{\\sum\\limits\_{t=-n}^{0} (1-\\alpha)^{-t} x(-t)}{\\sum\\limits\_{t=-n}^{0} (1-\\alpha)^{-t}}$$

  If `adjust = False`, EMA is calculated such that

  $$EMA(t) = (1-\\alpha)EMA(t-1) + \\alpha x(t)$$
  $$EMA(t=0) = x(0)$$

  By default, adjust = True, to give better estimates for starting intervals.

  The following are alternative methods to specify the $\\alpha$ parameter.

  - **span**: specify alpha in terms of span, such that

    $$\\alpha = \\frac{2}{span+1}$$

  - **com**: specify alpha in terms of centre of mass, such that

    $$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1+com}$$

  - **halflife**: Halflife is different from the other parameters. Half-life is a timedelta argument that specifies the half-life of observation weights. Half-life is useful when observations are irregularly spaced and a better estimate is needed to properly weight more recent data. Let $t\_{-1}$ be the time of the last observation.

    Then:

    $$\\lambda(t)  = 1 - \\exp(\\frac{-(t-t\_{-1})\*\\ln(2)}{halflife})$$
    $$EMA(t) = \\frac{ \\lambda(t)\*EMA(t-1) + x(t)}{\\text{normalization constant}}$$

    Something to note is that the `ignore_na` flag does not matter if a halflife interval is specified.
    The behavior would be the same in both cases, since an absolute time interval is being used to re-weight the moving average, not a tick interval.

    **Exactly one of alpha, span, com, halflife must be given**

- **adjust**: if True, early observations are adjusted to give a more "smoothed" estimate of the EMA. The difference is that if `adjust=True`, then each new observation receives a relative weight of 1. If adjust = False, each new observation receives a relative weight of alpha.

  - `adjust=True` means that:

  $$EMA(t) = \\frac{x(t)+(1-\\alpha)x(t-1)+(1-\\alpha)^2 x(t-2) + ... + (1-\\alpha)^n x(t-n)}{1+(1-\\alpha)+(1-\\alpha)^ 2 + ... + (1-\\alpha)^n}$$

  - `adjust=False` means that:

  $$EMA(t) = \\frac{\\alpha * x(t) + \\alpha * (1-\\alpha) * x(t-1) + \\alpha * (1-\\alpha)^2 * x(t-2) + ... + \\boldsymbol{(1-\\alpha)^n x(0)}}{\\alpha+\\alpha\*(1-\\alpha)+\\alpha\*(1-\\alpha)^ 2 + ... + (1-\\alpha)^n}$$

  $$\\text{and thus } EMA(t=0) = x(0)$$

  Adjust only applies with tick specified intervals, not time specified intervals. Time specified intervals (i.e. half-life) do not need adjustment as they are, by definition, already adjusted.

- **horizon**: the maximum number of ticks to use in the computation. For example, if horizon = 10, then only the 10 most recent data points are used. If not specified, all data points for x are used, with early ticks decaying exponentially in weighting. Horizon will be ignored with a half-life (time-based) interval.

  - If horizon is set to *h*, then even if x has more than *h* ticks the EMA will computed as such if `adjust=True`.

  $$EMA(t) = \\frac{\\sum\_{t=-h}^{0} (1-\\alpha)^{-t} x(t)}{\\sum\_{t=-h}^{0} (1-\\alpha)^{-t}}$$

  - The only difference if `adjust=False` is that the first ever tick, while in the window, receives weight 1 at the start instead of weight  $\\alpha$ like the rest of the values.

- **ignore_na**: if True, nan values will be "ignored" meaning weights will be placed on relative position. If False (default), weights are based on global position, and renormalized as such.

  - For example, let us consider a dataset (1,nan,2) using `adjust=True`.
    - If `ignore_na=True` then the weighting is based on *relative position* as such:
      $$EMA(t=2) = \\frac{(1-\\alpha)\*1 + 2}{(1-\\alpha)+1}$$
    - If `ignore_na=False` then the weighting is based on *global position* as such:
      $$EMA(t=2) = \\frac{(1-\\alpha)^2\*1 + 2}{(1-\\alpha)^2+1}$$

- **trigger**: another time-series which can be used to externally trigger computations. Whenever the trigger ticks, the given statistic will be updated and returned

  - *By default*, the trigger is the series itself.

- **sampler**: another optional time-series which specifies when x *should* tick. The behavior is as follows:

  - If x ticks \*and \*sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered valid and is used.
  - If x ticks but sampler does not tick, then the x tick is considered invalid and is ignored.
  - If x does not tick but sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered NaN and is handled based on the ignore_na flag.
  - *By default*, the sampler is the series itself.

- **reset**: another optional time-series which, when ticked, will clear all data in the interval and "reset" the calculation.

- **recalc**: another optional time-series which triggers a clean recalculation of the EMA, and in doing so clears any accumulated floating-point error.

  - Note: *only valid when a finite-horizon EMA is used*.

- **min_data_points**: the minimum number of valid (non-nan) data points that must exist in the interval for a calculation to be valid. If there are fewer than min_data_point, NaN is returned.

Returns:

- a time-series of exponentially-weighted moving averages over the interval.

- **x**: the time-series of dimension `(N,)` arrays which represent `N` variables
- **interval**: the rolling interval over which to use data. If unspecified or set to None, an expanding (unbounded) window will be used.

  - if a timedelta, represents the time interval to keep data (non-inclusive at left endpoint)

  - If the interval is a tick count then this must also be a tick count. Example: interval=100, min_window=50 means to use a 100-tick rolling interval with no output until we have 50 ticks

    min_window: Union[timedelta, int] = None,
    ignore_na: bool = True,
    trigger: ts[object] = None,
    weights: ts[Union[float, np.ndarray]] = None,
    sampler: ts[object] = None,
    reset: ts[object] = None,
    recalc: ts[object] = None,
    min_data_points: int = 0
) → ts[np.ndarray]
```

Args:

- **x**: the time-series of dimension `(N,)` arrays which represent `N` variables
- **interval**: the rolling interval over which to use data.
  If unspecified or set to None, an expanding (unbounded) window will be used.
  - if an int, represents the number of ticks to use
  - if a timedelta, represents the time interval to keep data (non-inclusive at left endpoint)
- **min_window**: the minimum allowable interval to use before outputting data
  - If the interval is a timedelta then this must also be a timedelta. Example: interval=60s, min_window=30s means to use a 60s rolling interval with no output for the first 30s.
  - If the interval is a tick count then this must also be a tick count. Example: interval=100, min_window=50 means to use a 100-tick rolling interval with no output until we have 50 ticks
- **ignore_na**: if True, does not include any nan values in the window. If false, nan values in the window will make the entire window value nan.
- **trigger**: another time-series which can be used to externally trigger computations. Whenever the trigger ticks, the given statistic will be updated and returned
  - *By default*, the trigger is the series itself.
- **weights:** a time-series of weights for each observation in x, used to calculate a weighted correlation matrix (optional). Weights do not need to be normalized.
- **sampler**: another optional time-series which specifies when x *should* tick. The behavior is as follows:
  - If x ticks \*and \*sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered valid and is used.
  - If x ticks but sampler does not tick, then the x tick is considered invalid and is ignored.
  - If x does not tick but sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered NaN and is handled based on the ignore_na flag.
  - *By default*, the sampler is the series itself.
- **reset**: another optional time-series which, when ticked, will clear all data in the interval and "reset" the calculation
- **recalc**: another optional time-series which triggers a clean recalculation of the statistic, and in doing so clears any accumulated floating-point error.
- **min_data_points**: the minimum number of valid (non-nan) data points that must exist in the interval for a calculation to be valid. If there are fewer than min_data_point, NaN is returned.

Returns:

- a time-series of (potentially weighted) correlation matrices, each of which is a NumpyNDArray of dimensionality `(N,N)`

**1. Covariance**

```python
x = {'2020-01-01': np.array([0., 0., 0.]), '2020-01-02': np.array([1., -1., 2.]), '2020-01-03': np.array([2., -2., 4.])}
cov_matrix(x, 3, ddof=0)
```

```python
{'2020-01-03': np.array([1, -1, 2],
                     [-1, 1, -2],
                      [2, -2, 4])}
```

**2. Correlation**

```python
corr_matrix(x, 3)
```

```python

### NumPy Conversions

```python
list_to_numpy(x: [ts[float]], fillna: bool = False) → ts[np.ndarray]
```

Args:

- **x**: a listbasket of time series
- **fillna**: If False, unticked elements are treated as NaN.
  If True, unticked elements will hold their previous value in the array.

Returns:

- a NumPy 1D array where each value corresponds to the element of the listbasket with the same index

```python
numpy_to_list(x: ts[np.ndarray], n: int) → [ts[float]]
```

Args:

- **x**: a NumPy array valued time series
- **n**: the number of output channels in the listbasket
  Returns:
- a listbasket where each value corresponds to the element of the array with the same index

#### Examples: NumPy Conversions

Starttime: `2020-01-01 00:00:00`

**1. List to NumPy**

```python
x1 = {'2020-01-01': 1, '2020-01-02': 2, '2020-01-03': 3}
x2 = {'2020-01-01': 1.5, '2020-01-03': 3.5}
list_to_numpy([x1,x2], fillna=False)
```

```python
{'2020-01-01': [1, 1.5], '2020-01-02': [2, np.nan], '2020-01-03': [3, 3.5]} # no x2 tick on day 2
```

```python
list_to_numpy([x1,x2], fillna=True)
```

```python
{'2020-01-01': [1, 1.5], '2020-01-02': [2, 1.5], '2020-01-03': [3, 3.5]} # holds x2 value for day 2
```

x_np = {'2020-01-01': [1,2], '2020-01-02': [3,4], '2020-01-03': [5,6]}
numpy_to_list(x_np, 2)
```

```python
[
    {'2020-01-01': 1, '2020-01-02': 3, '2020-01-03': 5},
    {'2020-01-01': 2, '2020-01-02': 4, '2020-01-03': 6}
]
```

## Cross-Sectional Statistics

### Cross Sectional

```python
cross_sectional(
    x: ts[Union[float,np.ndarray]],
    interval: Union[timedelta, int] = None,
    min_window: Union[timedelta, int] = None,
    trigger: ts[object] = None,
    as_numpy: bool = False,
    sampler: ts[object] = None,
    reset: ts[object] = None
) → ts[Union[np.ndarray, List[float], List[np.ndarray]]]
```

Args:

- **x**: the time-series data
- **interval**: the rolling interval over which to use data. If unspecified or set to None, an expanding (unbounded) window will be used.
  - if an int, represents the number of ticks to use
  - if a timedelta, represents the time interval to keep data (non-inclusive at left endpoint)
- **min_window**: the minimum allowable interval to use before outputting data
  - If the interval is a timedelta then this must also be a timedelta. Example: interval=60s, min_window=30s means to use a 60s rolling interval with no output for the first 30s.
  - If the interval is a tick count then this must also be a tick count. Example: interval=100, min_window=50 means to use a 100-tick rolling interval with no output until we have 50 ticks
- **as_numpy:** if True, the data will be returned as a NumPy array instead of a list.
  - For a single-valued time series, this is a one-dimensional NumPy array
  - For a NumPy array time series, this is a NumPy array of one extra dimension
- **trigger**: another time-series which can be used to externally trigger computations. Whenever the trigger ticks, the given statistic will be updated and returned
  - *By default*, the trigger is the series itself.
- **sampler**: another optional time-series which specifies when x *should* tick. The behavior is as follows:
  - If x ticks \*and \*sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered valid and is used.
  - If x ticks but sampler does not tick, then the x tick is considered invalid and is ignored.
  - If x does not tick but sampler ticks, then the x tick is considered NaN and is handled based on the ignore_na flag.
  - *By default*, the sampler is the series itself.
- **reset**: another optional time-series which, when ticked, will clear all data in the interval and "reset" the calculation

Returns:

- a time-series where each tick contains all the data of *x* currently within the interval. Use this for custom cross-sectional calculations

#### Examples: Cross-sectional calculations

Starttime: `2020-01-01 00:00:00`

```python
x = {'2020-01-01': 1, '2020-01-01': 2, '2020-01-01': 3, '2020-01-01': 4, '2020-01-01': 5}
cs = cross_sectional(x, interval=3, min_window=2)
cs
```

```python
{'2020-01-02': [1,2], '2020-01-03': [1,2,3], '2020-01-04': [2,3,4], '2020-01-05': [3,4,5]}
```

**Calculate a cross-sectional mean**

```python
cs_mean = csp.apply(cs, lambda v: sum(v)/len(v), float)
cs_mean
```

```python
{'2020-01-02': 1.5, '2020-01-03': 2.0, '2020-01-04': 3.0, '2020-01-05': 4.0}
```

**Get the results as a NumPy array**

```python
cs = cross_sectional(x, interval=3, min_window=2, as_numpy=True)
cs
```

```python
{'2020-01-02': np.array([1,2]), '2020-01-03': np.array([1,2,3]), '2020-01-04': np.array([2,3,4]), '2020-01-05': np.array([3,4,5])}
```
