## `csp.profiler()`

Users can simply run graphs under a `Profiler()` context to extract profiling information.
The code snippet below runs a graph in profile mode and extracts the profiling data by calling `results()`.

```python
from csp import profiler

with profiler.Profiler() as p:
    results = csp.run(graph, starttime=st, endtime=et) # run the graph normally

prof_data = p.results() # extract profiling data
```

Calling `results()` will return a ProfilerInfo object which contains the following attributes:

- **`cycle_count`**: the total number of engine cycles executed during the run
- **`average_cycle_time`**: the average time of a single engine cycle
- **`max_cycle_time`**: the maximum time of a single engine cycle
- **`utilization`**: the average "fraction of the graph" which runs each cycle. Defined as: (total number of node executions) / (number of nodes in the graph * cycle_count)\`
- **`node_stats`**: a dictionary where node_stats\["nodetype"\] holds the execution level data for each nodetype that was executed during the run. This data is stored as a dictionary with keys:
  - **`executions`**: the total number of times the nodetype was executed throughout the run
  - **`max_time`**: the maximum amount of time (in seconds) it took for that nodetype to execute
  - **`total_time`**: the total amount of time (in seconds) it took for that nodetype to execute throughout the run
- **`graph_info`**: a static GraphInfo object (see section 2 below) which is stored in the ProfilerInfo object
- **`build_time`**: the graph build time in seconds. This will be only computed if the graph is built under the profiler context i.e. the graph is not pre-built outside of the "with profiler" block

ProfilerInfo additionally comes with some useful utilities. These are:

- **`ProfilerInfo.print_stats(self, sort_by: str="total_time", max_nodes: int=100)`**
  - Prints profiling statistics in a table format for each node
    - **`sort_by`**: key to sort node data by. Valid keys are: "name", "executions", "total_time", "max_time". All keys are presented in descending order except for name, which is ascending.
    - **`max_nodes`**: the maximum number of nodes to display in the node data table.
- **`ProfilerInfo.dump_stats(self, filename: str)`**
  - Writes the ProfilerInfo object to a file which can be shared and restored later.
    - **`filename`**: the filename to write to.
- **`ProfilerInfo.load_stats(self, filename: str)`**
  - Loads a ProfilerInfo object from a file. Returns the object.
    - **`filename`**: the filename to read from.
- **`ProfilerInfo.max_time_node(self)`**
  - Returns the node type which had the largest total execution time as a tuple: `(name, node_stat)` where node_stat is a dictionary with the same keys asÂ `node_stats[elem]`
- **`ProfilerInfo.max_exec_node(self)`**
  - Returns the node type which had the most total executions as a tuple: `(name, node_stat)` where node_stat is a dictionary with the same keys as `node_stats[elem]`

## `profiler.graph_info()`

Users can also extract build-time information about the graph without running it by calling profiler.graph_info.
The code snippet below shows how to call graph_info.

```python
from csp import profiler

info = profiler.graph_info(graph)
```

`info` is a GraphInfo object which contains the following attributes:

- **`node_count`**: the total number of nodes in the graph (including input/output adapters)
- **`edge_count`**: the total number of edges in the graph
- **`nodetype_counts`**: the number of each type of node in the graph
  i.e. nodetype_counts\['filter'\] = 3 means there are 3 filter nodes in the graph
- **`longest_path`**: the longest path in the graph, represented as a list that contains all nodes in the path from start to end

GraphInfo additionally comes with some useful utilities. These are:

- **`GraphInfo.print_info(self, sort_by: str="count", max_nodes: int=100)`**
  - Prints graph info in a table format for each node
    - **`sort_by`**: key to sort node data by. Valid keys are: "name", "count".
      Sorting by name is ascending (alphabetical) and sorting by count is descending.
    - **`max_nodes`**: the maximum number of nodes to display in the node data table.
- **`GraphInfo.most_common_node(self)`**
  - Returns the most common node type in the graph as a tuple: `(name, count)`

One can use these metrics to identify critical paths/design flaws in their graphs.
