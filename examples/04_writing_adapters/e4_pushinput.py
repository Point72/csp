"""
PushInputAdapter is the simplest form of an input adapter for real-time data. One instance is created
to provide data on a single timeseries. There are use cases for this construct, though they are limited.
This is useful when feeding a single source of data into a single timeseries. In most cases however,
you will likely have a single source that is processed and used to provide data to multiple inputs. For that construct
see e5_adaptermanager_pushinput.py
