This example introduces the concept of an AdapterManager for realtime data. AdapterManagers are constructs that are used
when you have a shared input or output resources (ie single CSV / Parquet file, some pub/sub session, etc)
that you want to connect to once, but provide data to/from many input/output adapters (aka time series)
