# Custom C++ Adapter

> [!WARNING]
> This example is for demonstration, and is a pattern CSP uses internally for adapters.
> It is not recommended to use as the C++ API is not stable and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.
> For adapters, we have a stable C API that is recommended to use instead. See [C API Adapter](../4_c_api_adapter/README.md) example for more details.
