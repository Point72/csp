    "When using CSP to ingest and analyze this data, we start with a graph representing the operations we want to perform. Graphs are composed of some number of \"input\" adapters, a set of connected calculation \"nodes\" and at the end sent off to \"output\" adapters. For simplicity, we'll build a very simple graph that will show trains passing through 34 St-Penn Station.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of [Input Adapters](https://github.com/Point72/csp/wiki/5.-Adapters): Historical (aka Simulated) adapters and Realtime Adapters. Historical adapters are used to feed in historical timeseries data into the graph from some data source which has timeseries data. Realtime Adapters are used to feed in live event based data in realtime, generally events created from external sources on separate threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have guessed, in our case we need to use a Realtime adapter, which will ingest the data and periodically refresh it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CSP terminology, a single adapter corresponds to a single timeseries edge in the graph. When writing realtime adapters, you will need to implement a \"push\" adapter, which will get data from a separate thread that drives external events and \"pushes\" them into the engine as they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing input adapters it is also very important to denote the difference between \"graph building time\" and \"runtime\" versions of your adapter. For example, `csp.adapters.csv` has a `CSVReader` class that is used at graph building time. Graph build time components solely describe the adapter. They are meant to do little else than keep track of the type of adapter and its parameters, which will then be used to construct the actual adapter implementation when the engine is constructed from the graph description. It is the runtime implementation that actual runs during the engine execution phase to process data.\n",

    "> through the graph, driven by input ticks.\n",
