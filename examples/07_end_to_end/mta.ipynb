    "When using CSP to ingest and analyze this data, we start with a graph representing the operations we want to perform. [CSP Graphs](https://github.com/Point72/csp/wiki/CSP-Graph) are composed of some number of \"input\" adapters, a set of connected calculation \"nodes\" and at the end sent off to \"output\" adapters. For simplicity, we'll build a graph that will show trains passing through 34 St-Penn Station.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of [Input Adapters](https://github.com/Point72/csp/wiki/5.-Adapters): Historical (aka Simulated) adapters and Realtime Adapters. Historical adapters are used to feed in historical timeseries data into the graph. Realtime Adapters are used to feed in live event data, generally created from external sources on separate threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have guessed, in our case we need to use a [Realtime adapter](https://github.com/Point72/csp/wiki/Write-Realtime-Input-Adapters), which will ingest the data and periodically refresh it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CSP terminology, a single adapter corresponds to a single timeseries edge in the graph. When writing realtime adapters, you will need to implement a \"push\" adapter, which will get data from a separate thread that drives external events and \"pushes\" them into the engine as they occur. For this, [we will need \"graph building time\" and \"runtime\" versions of your adapter](https://github.com/Point72/csp/wiki/Write-Realtime-Input-Adapters#pushinputadapter---python). \n",
    "\n",
    "> Once the graph is constructed, `csp.graph` code is no longer needed. Once the\n",
    "> graph is run, only inputs, `csp.nodes` and outputs will be active as data flows\n",
    "> through the graph, driven by input ticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, \"ticks\" correspond to feed refreshes, and we'll observe this data being updated every 30s. We will read 3 minutes of data for the purposes of this demonstration."
